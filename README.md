## About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.

This book is in perpetual beta, it's constantly changing. If you see something that could be improved: that's your invitation to improve it! [Find out more about editing the handbook](guides/contributing.md).

## Structure

The book is broken up into chapters and sub-chapters. The chapters are:

* [**Agreements**](agreements/) are the official legislation that governs the Enspiral network. Changing these requires a formal process.
* [**Guides**](guides/) explain in practical terms how we do stuff, like [what communications tools to use](guides/comms\_guidelines.md), or [how to improve things at Enspiral](guides/improvements.md). Any Enspiral Contributor can change these.
* [**Working Groups**](working-groups/) Working groups are where we do work on the network.
* [**Enspiral Foundation**](foundation/) - the central node in the network. The [Board](foundation/board.md), [Ops Team](foundation/ops-scope.md), [Comms person](foundation/comms-role.md), and [Ventures](ventures/) all have some formal arrangement with the Foundation, which is owned by Foundation Shareholders.
* [**Money**](money/) - a lot of what makes Enspiral special is how we deal with money. Read more about those processes in this chapter.
* [**Ventures**](ventures/) - the companies that make up the network.
