**Founding Date & Brief History**

The Scoop Foundation for Public Interest Journalism was incorporated as a Trust on the 8th of September 2015.

Scoop Publishing is the publisher of Scoop.co.nz, the leading independent New Zealand news site founded in 1999 on June 10th.

**Legal structure**

The Scoop Foundation for Public Interest Journalism is a charitable trust board established for the purposes of “supporting the publication of trustworthy, relevant, public interest information, freely accessible to all New Zealanders, so that they can participate in democratic processes.”

The Scoop Foundation is the sole owner of Scoop Publishing Limited, a social enterprise, which is structured as a not for profit company with the same purposes as the trust.

This relationship provides the trust with an influential platform from which to build a sustainable financial base – by supporting its fundraising activities – and to provide opportunities for broa d distribution of public interest journalism content commissioned by the Trust.

The editorial independence of the Scoop Publishing company is enshrined in our trust deed.

**Business Model**

Scoop Publishing is transitioning to a sustainable business model, based on selling ethical paywall commercial use licenses. Scoop’s ‘ethical paywall’, will also ensure the New Zealand public free and unlimited access to news on Scoop so everyone can be informed.

**Social Impact Strategy / Theory of Change**

The social impact strategy of the Scoop Foundation is to recreate the future of news media in New Zealand by creating an independent, sustainable and participatory model for news publishing. This will be achieved by providing education, support and finance for high quality independent journalism in New Zealand which we believe will play a vital role in our democracy. The Foundation also seeks to open source the learnings and technological tools developed in the process to assist other organisations to follow this path and form an ecosystem of independent news and media publishers.

The Scoop Foundation is a member focused organisation and is committed to transparency, accountability and providing meaningful opportunities for members to participate in shaping the organisation.
