**Venture Description (200 words)**

Enspiral Labs helps networks, organisations and individuals work in open, participatory and collaborative ways. We do this in two ways;

Tools and Support: to help people increase engagement, responsiveness and productivity throughout their organisation.

Education and Training: to help people stay at the forefront of a dynamic and evolving field challenging traditional management theory.

We are a diverse team of technologists, designers and organisational consultants, drawing on our experience building the Enspiral Network.

Enspiral Labs is also an applied R & D lab for the commons where we build collaborative, participatory tools for business, civic society and government.

Our intention is to swarm and apply focused energy to developing products that support our mission and scale them out to their own ventures or share our learnings from the experiment and move on.
