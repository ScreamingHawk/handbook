# Stewardship Agreement

Every new contributor has a steward. By default, this will be the person who added them, unless arranged to be someone else.

As a _new contributor_, your steward is your point of contact who helps you find your way around Enspiral when you arrive. You and your steward can agree the scope of the role together. As a suggested start point, they should touch base with you once per month to see how youâ€™re going.

As a _steward_, you will encourage and support them to join a pod when suited. You are expected to make sure another Member or Catalyst knows if you become unable to fulfill your role.
