# Activation Programme

This is an experiment that is currently being run with new contributors.

## What is it for?

This programme aims is to support new contributors to become quickly active in the community through a "learning by doing" process. It consists in completing a list of easy / intermediate / hard challenges that will help any new contributor know more about Enspiral processes, people and culture.

What are the challenges?

### Easy challenges

* Enspiral processes
  * join a working group
  * give feedback on the activation programme
* Enspiral people
  * attend an in person enspiral event
  * interview an old timer
* Enspiral culture and ideas
  * write a blog post
  * create a loomio thread
  * share something that excites you on Facebook group / watercooler channel

### Intermediate challenges

* update the handbook
* create an improvement ticket
* create a bucket in cobudget
* get paid from a bucket
* complete an improvement ticket (alone or with someone else)

### Harder challenges

* steward a new contributor through the activation programme
* find paying work for someone enspiral

## What is the experiment process?

The experiment was kicked off at the beginning of sprint 30, with a loomio invitation to recruit initial voluntary participants. We will be holding fortnightly check-in threads in slack and tracking engagement with a monthly survey to get feedback from the participants.

Here are the success criteria we will be assessing:

* How many people opt in to the experiment
* How many challenges people complete
* How much all the participants felt part of the community after completing some/all challenges
* How easy to use all the participants found it
* How much support participants receive to complete the challenges.

This chapter will eventually be a whole section with different pages.

* Overview of different ways people engage as individuals at Enspiral
* How to become a contributor, then a member
* Individual opt-in and contribution process
* Onboarding documentation
* Link to People Agreement
* Link to list of Members
