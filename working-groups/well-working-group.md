# Well Working Group

## Well Working Group has been disbanded \(at least for time being\)

The **Catalysts are currently the point people** for inquiries, comments or concerns around Personal Conduct. The **Personal Conduct Agreement** suggests that the Well Working Group will be the container for "developing network resources for constructive dialogue and co-working." However, per the Catalyst [Agreement](../agreements/catalyst.md) \(currently intepreted in part as, '[Keep critical functions operational](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_38ZaDk7QO2RZFc7ZyMbQURG2zNb31tmq16198bsaKE/edit?usp=sharing)'\).

If you currently feel unsafe in Enspiral's communication channels, please immediately e-mail foundation@enspiral.com â€“ the [Harassment & Abuse Policy](../agreements/harassment_and_abuse.md) can help if you are uncertain for any reason.
