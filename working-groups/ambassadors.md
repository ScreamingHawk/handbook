If it does not activate before next Working Group status check (typically before Assembly Sprints) then this page will be removed for now.

Ambassadoring is a working group in Enspiral focused on outreach and connecting with other organisations.

## Working with Ambassadors

### Why do Ambassadors exist?

It can be challenging for external people and organisations to have a relationship with Enspiral. Ambassadors are people who are confident and supported to represent Enspiral and maintain long term relationships with external groups and individuals.

### What do Ambassadors do?

They spend time with people and help them find opportunities to collaborate with Enspiral people and Ventures. This involves lots of calls and face to face meetings, spending the time to understand other organisations and hunting for meaningful value exchanges.

### I've found someone I want an Ambassador to talk to, what to do?

Ooh, we love introductions! You can either post a message in our slack group or send an email to [ambassadors@enspiral.com](mailto:ambassadors@enspiral.com)

### I'm looking for an introduction to one of our friends, can Ambassadors help?

Absolutely. We know literally tons of people (well, tens of tons actually, people are heavy!) - just post up in our slack channel what sort of connection you are looking for and we will do our best to help.

### Who are our current Ambassadors?

* Joshua Vial
* Susan Basterfield
* Damian Sligo-Green
* Genevieve Parkes
* Kate Beecroft
* Lucas Tauil de Freitas
* Richard Bartlett
* Rose Lu
* Sandra Chemin
* Tamas Hovanyecz

## Ambassadoring

### How do I become an Ambassador?

Jump up in the #ambassadors slack channel and talk to the other Ambassadors. This role is open to both Members and Contributors, the more you know about Enspiral then the easier the work is but if you're still finding your way then the old hands are happy to pair with you. Once both you and the other Ambassadors are confident you will be invited to our Loomio group, added to hubspot and be an official Ambassador.

### What are the commitments of being an Ambassador?

You are expected to log your 'official' Ambassador calls you make in the slack channel and Hubspot so other Ambassadors have visibility on the relationships you are maintaining. If you step back from Ambassador work you are expected to make introductions to other Ambassadors who can continue the relationship.

### Is it paid?

No, we don't have the resources to pay for Ambassadoring so this is a volunteer role.

### Are there any time commitments?

No, you are free to do as much or as little Ambassadoring as you like.

### How do I step back?

We run a standard 6 monthly opt in to stay an Ambassador which is a good time to reflect on your commitments. You can also step back whenever feels right. Don't worry, you'll be welcome back anytime :)

### Where do Ambassadors meet?

You can find us at #ambassadors on slack and in our [Loomio Group](https://www.loomio.org/g/E8AxB315/enspiral-enspiral-ambassadors). We occasionally have Ambassador calls to sync up.

### Meh, I'm not up for all this process, but I do represent Enspiral and meet interesting folks from time to time.

No problems, it would help us if you dropped a message in the #ambassadors slack channel but fly free you free spirit you.
